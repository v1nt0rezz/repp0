"""
git and python powered ftp client.

It uses git to determine which local files have changed since the last 
deployment to the remote server and saves you time and bandwidth by uploading 
only those files.

It keeps track of the deployed state by uploading the SHA1 of the last deployed 
commit in a log file.

Usage:
    git-ftp init [URL] [options]
    git-ftp push [URL] [options]
    git-ftp show [URL] [options]
    git-ftp catchup [URL] [options]

Options:
    --version                           Show version.
    -h --help                           Show help.
